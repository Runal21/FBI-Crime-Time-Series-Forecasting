# 📊 FBI Crime Time Series Forecasting - Data Analyst Project

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **FBI crime data** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)** to identify crime patterns, hotspots, and future crime trends. By leveraging **machine learning and visualization techniques**, this project helps law enforcement and policymakers **improve public safety and crime prevention strategies**.  

---

## 📌 Key Features  
✅ **Crime Trend Analysis** – Identifies seasonal crime patterns  
✅ **Hotspot Detection** – Maps high-crime areas using geospatial analysis  
✅ **Time-based Crime Patterns** – Analyzes crime rates by hour, day, and month  
✅ **Crime Forecasting** – Uses **ARIMA models** to predict future crime rates  
✅ **Correlation Analysis** – Detects relationships between time, location, and crime type
